            <h3>Cashflow tabs.</h3>

            <p>A tab represents an open cashflow. Clicking on a tab activates that particular
            cashflow and deactivates any previously active cashflow. Activating a tab shows that
            cashflow's event grid, amortization grid, summary, and status line.</p>
            
            <p>Each tab displays the cashflow name, a button that displays the cashflow preferences,
            and another button ("X") that closes the cashflow. When a cashflow has been updated, an asterisk
            ("*") displays next to the cashflow name in the tab.</p>
        
            <h3>Creating a new cashflow.</h3>

            <p>When a new cashflow is created, a dialog is shown that asks for a name (for the cashflow)
            and the template group the cashflow will be based upon. The cashflow name and template group name
            are required fields. Template groups designate an initial template event that will be automatically 
            copied into the cashflow.</p>
                    
            <h3>Opening an existing cashflow.</h3>

            <p>An open dialog appears asking for a AmFn JSON file name. Usually, the
            JSON file represents a single cashflow. The AmFn Wasm JSON file may also contain any
            number of user preferences, templates, exchange rates, etc.</p>
                    
            <h3>Closing an existing cashflow.</h3>

            <p>Close an opened cashflow. If the cashflow has been updated, an asterisk ("*") appears
            next to the caption of the cashflow tab and a close will be confirmed.</p>

            <h3>Saving an opened cashflow.</h3>

            <p>The currently selected cashflow is saved in the AmFn compliant
            JSON file format. The saved cashflow may be retrieved at a later date
            by the Open action.</p>

            <p>Note: If an asterisk ("*") appears next to the caption of the cash
            flow tab, the cashflow has changes that are unsaved, otherwise the
            cashflow has no outstanding changes.</p>

            <h3>Inserting a new event.</h3>

            <p>A new event can be inserted into the currently selected cashflow by using the 
            Cashflow Insert button. When cashflows are created, they specify a particular
            template group. The template group contains template events for all the types
            of events that can be created from that group.</p>
            
            <p>The list of template events for that template group is shown to the user. A specific 
            template event can be selected from the list. The template event is then copied into the
            cashflow's event list based upon the date of the currently selected event (or today's 
            date if no event is selected). To reorder the event, simply change the date to the 
            desired new date. After date, the minor sort key is the sort order (usually not shown
            in the grids) that has been preset by the template events.</p>

            <p>After creating the template event into the cashflow, if any events have one or more
            parameters, the parameters dialog is shown to the user asking for initial inputs. This
            signifies a more complex type of event such as a graduated payment. These type of
            events have one or more expressions in applicable fields that calculate their values
            based upon the parameter values entered.</p>

            <h3>Deleting the currently selected event.</h3>

            <p>An event can be deleted from the currently active cashflow by selecting a cell in the
            applicable grid row and using the Delete Event button.</p>

            <h3>Calculating the value of the selected event cell.</h3>

            <p>The selected event cell of the active cashflow can be calculated by
            using the Cashflow Calculate button. When a particular column of the cashflow can be 
            calculated, the Calculate Cashflow button will become enabled.

            <h3>Expand/Compress amortization.</h3>

            <p>The user can switch between the compressed cashflow view and the expanded
            amortization view by toggling the "Expand/Compress" button.</p>

            <h3>Cashflow events.</h3>

            <p>The event grid is the top-most grid within the cashflow. All editing of 
            cashflow events is accomplished via this grid.</p>

            <p>Each row of the event grid represents a separate event, while each
            column of an event grid represents a different field of an event. The
            columns that are shown for a particular cashflow and the ordering of
            those columns can vary substantially between cashflows of different types
            (i.e., loans versus investments, etc.).</p>

            <p>A number of columns contain a selection button in the right side of the cell. By pressing
            this button, a dialog or selection list is shown that assists in viewing or editing the
            content of the cell.</p>

            <p>The columns and rows of the event grid are navigated in a left-to-right and
            top-to-bottom manner. While the mouse may be used to position between cells of
            individual events, keystrokes will be used in a large number of cases (if not
            exclusively by some users).</p>
                
            <h3>Expanded amortization.</h3>

            <p>The expanded amortization grid is the "primary" bottom-most
            grid within the cashflow. All editing of cashflow events is accomplished
            with the event grid shown above this grid (i.e., the expanded amortization grid and
            it's respective dialogs are read-only).</p>

            <p>Each row of the expanded amortization grid represents a separate expanded event, while
            each column represents a different field of an expanded event. The columns that are shown
            for a particular cashflow and the ordering of those columns can vary substantially between
            Cashflows of different types (i.e., loans versus investments, etc.).</p>

            <p>A number of columns contain a selection button in the right side of the cell. By pressing
            this button, a dialog or selection list is shown that assists in viewing the content
            of the cell.</p>

            <p>The columns and rows of the expanded amortization grid are navigated in a left-to-right,
            top-to-bottom manner. While the mouse may be used to position between cells of individual
            expanded events, keystrokes will be used in a large number of cases (if not exclusively by
            some users).</p>

            <h3>Compressed amortization.</h3>

            <p>The compressed cashflow grid is the "secondary" bottom-most
            grid within the cashflow. All editing of cashflow events is accomplished
            with the event grid shown above this grid (i.e., the compressed cashflow grid and
            it's respective dialogs are read-only).</p>

            <p>Each row of the compressed cashflow grid represents a separate compressed event, while
            each column represents a different field of a compressed event. The columns that are shown
            for a particular cashflow and the ordering of those columns can vary substantially between
            Cashflows of different types (i.e., loans versus investments, etc.).</p>

            <p>A number of columns contain a selection button in the right side of the cell. By pressing
            this button, a dialog or selection list is shown that assists in viewing the content
            of the cell.</p>

            <p>The columns and rows of the compressed cashflow grid are navigated in a left-to-right,
            top-to-bottom manner. While the mouse may be used to position between cells of individual
            compressed events, keystrokes will be used in a large number of cases (if not exclusively by
            some users).</p>

            <h3>Cashflow summary.</h3>

            <p>The summary of the currently selected cashflow can be shown by using the Summary
            button. The summary shows two columns and a variable number of
            rows. The number of rows that are shown depends upon the number of summary
            item descriptors that were defined for the cashflow (normally created via a template
            group).</p>

            <p>The first column displays the resolved label expression that was declared
            with each summary item. The second column displays the resolved result
            expression that was also declared with each summary item.</p>

            <h3>Cashflow charts.</h3>

            <p>The chart definitions for the currently selected cashflow can be shown by
            using the Cashflow Charts dropdown button. A number of chart definitions appear under the 
            charts dropdown.</p>

            <p>Charts definitions operate either on a single cashflow (i.e., the
            active cashflow) or all open cashflows. The icon displayed next to the chart name
            designates the type of chart (single or multiple).</p>

            <h3>Cashflow status line.</h3>

            <p>The status line view appears at bottom of each cashflow. It represents various
            statistics of the cashflow. The status line is automatically updated whenever the
            event grid is changed.</p>

            <p>The information that is shown in the status line can vary substantially between
            cashflows of different types (i.e., loans versus investments, etc.). The degree that
            the content of the status line varies between Cashflows is dependent upon the template
            that was chosen at the time that the cashflow was created.</p>

            <p>To the right of the status line is the AmFn Wasm version followed by the AmFn Engine
            version. To the right of the version, a button shows the user preferences dialog.</p>
